<!-- <p>Add an event listener to the start button, so that the cat starts moving across the screen when its clicked. -->
<!-- <p>Add an event listener to the stop button, so that the cat stops moving when clicked. -->
<!-- <p>Add an event listener to the speed button, so that the cat moves faster when it's clicked. -->
<p>When the cat reaches the edge of the screen, have her walk back to the start. Repeat forever.
<p>Make sure your code works even when the screen is resized (you will need to find the window width with Javascript.
<p>BONUS: When the cat reaches half way, have her stop and replace the image with a dancing cat gif for a moment, then resume.
